## Akadream 👋

Hi, I'm Guillaume Lortet, aka Akadream.
I am obsessed with creating tools and I'm actively developing my own game engine.

I am mainly using [MonoGame](https://monogame.net) to create games and game tools, but I am also working on the web development industry!

## My tools

Here are some tools I worked on (game and web):

- 🎮 [Almost Good Engine](https://github.com/akaadream/AlmostGoodEngine): My work in progress game engine
- 🎮 [MonoGame.Reload](https://github.com/akaadream/MonoGame.Reload): A hot reloading to for MonoGame
- ⌨️ [Docket](https://docket.akadream.fr/): A [Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/) testing tool (and soon Socket.IO and websocket)
